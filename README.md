Steps to start the app:

1. npm install
2. npm start

The app is running on port 3000 by default so make sure that one is available.
If not, you can always modify the config file in src/ but then you also have
to change the serverUrl variable in the corresponding figma plugin
in ui.html file.

App uses firebase for storage, all the config is already here and since its using the lite version
you dont need to install anything. If you want to see the data in the database i can share the project with you.
